          <p>
            I started in the year 2021 at the height of the covid-19 pandemic. I
            entered a Google Ads course and found that I really enjoyed the web
            development aspect of the course. I then decided to pursue a career
            in web development. I was mentored under a professional web
            developer and have been working on my own projects ever since.
